hi there!      this is pepzi talking to you in his second ever made text scroller on the c64!        i made a scroller a long long time ago, but i've lost the code for it :(            this text is not part of a demo, but just a simple project to do some experimentations with moving text around and scroll the screen to create a seemless scrolling text..       it starts over from the beginning as soon as a char(0) is found in the text.   the program automatically adds it to the end of the text, but i could do it manually as well with a text-editor.... pepzi signing off 2015-11-10 @ 00:30
